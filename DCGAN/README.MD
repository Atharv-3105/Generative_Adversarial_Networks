# ðŸŽ¨ DCGAN â€“ From Scratch (MNIST)

This project contains a from-scratch implementation of **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)** using **PyTorch**, trained on the **MNIST** dataset.

DCGAN replaces fully connected layers with **convolutional** and **transposed convolutional** layers to better model image structures.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Train a DCGAN model where:
- The **generator** learns to produce realistic 28Ã—28 handwritten digit images.
- The **discriminator** learns to distinguish between real MNIST images and fake generated ones.
