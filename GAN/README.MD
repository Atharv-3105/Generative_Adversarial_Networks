# ðŸ§  Vanilla GAN â€“ From Scratch (MNIST)

This project contains a minimal, from-scratch implementation of a **Vanilla Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** using **PyTorch**, trained on the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset**.

The implementation is designed for learning and experimentation, and all key components â€” generator, discriminator, training loop built manually.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Objective

Train a simple GAN where:
- The **generator** learns to generate handwritten digits (0â€“9).
- The **discriminator** distinguishes between real MNIST images and fake images produced by the generator.
